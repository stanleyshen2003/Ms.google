# Discription
A well-designed app to speak with the voice of Ms. Google

# Motivation
Being infected by Covid, my throat could't afford any vibration. Typing all the words every time is a little tiring, so I write this app to help save some time.

# Feature
- memorize 10 previous input records
- either type or choose from the previous records
- use invisible files to store records. If you have the option "see the invisible files" on, use [the other version](https://github.com/stanleyshen2003/speak-male)
or put it into a folder so that your desktop wouldn't become messy.
